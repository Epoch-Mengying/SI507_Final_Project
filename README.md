# SI507 Final Project: Ann Arbor's Best Restaurants from Yelp


>  "Very very special brunch at local! It's definitely worth coming on new year's day!" 
                                                             --- A Customer Review for The Boutique Cafe & Lounge from Yelp


## Goal of the Project

The goal of the project is to use python to get data from Yelp API on Ann Arbor's restaurants information and store the data into database for query/management. There will also be an interactive map built by Tableau and HTML for users to interact with. 

## Data Source: Yelp

Yelp is an application that provides restaurants' information/reviews. It is supported by multiple languages and is widely used in many countries such as the U.S. and Japan. After users pick a location(and other possible criteria), Yelp will return satisfying restaurants search results. 

Yelp @ Ann Arbor: https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=&find_loc=Ann+Arbor%2C+MI&ns=1

Tool to get the data: Yelp Fusion API, which uses OAuth 2.0 as Authentication.
  * API documentation homepage: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started
  * Search API documentation: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search
  * Reviews API documentation: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews

**IMPORTANT UPDATES: From December 8, 2017, Yelp simplifies the API process and change from using OAuth 2.0 to API key. However, this code will still work until Yelp completely stops using OAuth 2.0 starting March 1, 2018.**

## Outcome

### CSV files

There are two csv files that contain the information we have gained. Each csv's column names are provided below.

* restaurants.csv (saves restaurant basic information on name, category, rating, price level and location)
  * restaurant_id: the registered id of the restaurant
  * restaurant_name: the name of the restaurant
  * category: which categories the restaurant belongs to, eg. Coffee & Tea. can be multiple categories. stored in a list.
  * price_leve: range from $ to $$$$
  * ratings: range from 1 to 5, on a 1/2 interval
  * review_counts: total number of reviews
  * state: the location of the restauant
  * city
  * street_address
  * latitude
  * longitude
  
--> Search API documentation: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search


* reviews.csv
   * restaurant_id: the registered id of the restaurant
   * reiview_1: one review of the customer
   * review_2: one review of the customer
   * review_3: one review of the customer

--> Reviews API documentation: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews


**Note: This file only stores the three reviews extract returned by the API endpoints. At this time, the API does not return restaurants without any reviews.** 


### Database

There will be three tables stored in the database:

* Table1: Restaurants
  * id: PRIMARY KEY
  * restaurant_name
  * price_level
  * ratings
  * reviews_count
  * logitude
  * latitude
  * category id: FOREIGN KEY points to Table2 Category(id)
  * review id:  FOREIGN KEY points to Table3 Reviews(id)
  
  
* Table2: PriceLevel
  * id: PRIMARY KEY
  * price_level
  
* Table3: Reivews
  * id: PRIMARY KEY
  * review_1
  * review_2
  * review_3
  
  
### An Interactive Map

Unlike database, this interactive map allows the users to interact with 40 restaurants' information we gained in this project! 

Map is generated by Tableau, which will be displayed on the web. It shows 40 best restaurants on Yelp in Ann Arbor. User can click on point on the map to see the corresponding restaurants'information. Point size indicates the number of ratings, with bigger size meaning more number of reviews, and point color indicates the average rating.

Have fun!


## Instructions
The project is a bit completed. Here's **how to run the code**!
### Step 1: Create your own application on Yelp!
 [1] Go to Yelp API documentation: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3
 [2] Click on Create App at left under General
 [3] Check your client_ID and client_secret here: https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app
     Note, as this code uses OAuth 2.0, your don't need to worry about API key!
 [4] Fill in your client_ID and client_secret in **secret_data_sample.py** and rename it to **secret_data.py**

### Step 2: Changing the database user name to yours!
 [1] Open **config.py** and change it to your own user name! You don't need to change the database name.
