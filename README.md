# SI507 Final Project: Ann Arbor's Best Restaurants from Yelp


>  "Very very special brunch at local! It's definitely worth coming on new year's day!" 
                                                             --- A Customer Review for The Boutique Cafe & Lounge from Yelp


## Goal of the Project

The goal of the project is to use python to get data from Yelp API on Ann Arbor's restaurants information and store the data into database for query/management. There will also be an interactive map built by Flask and Tableau for users to interact with. 

## Data Source: Yelp

Yelp is an application that provides restaurants' information/reviews. It is supported by multiple languages and is widely used in many countries such as the U.S. and Japan. After users pick a location(and other possible criteria), Yelp will return satisfying restaurants search results. 

Yelp @ Ann Arbor: https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=&find_loc=Ann+Arbor%2C+MI&ns=1
Tool to get the data: Yelp Fusion API

  * Reviews API documentation: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews


## Outcome

### CSV files

There are two csv files that contain the information we have gained. Each csv's column names are provided below.

* restaurants.csv (saves restaurant basic information on name, category, rating, price level and location)
  * restaurant_name: the name of the restaurant
  * category: which category the restaurant belongs to, eg. Coffee & Tea
  * price_leve: range from $ to $$$$
  * ratings: range from 1 to 5, on a 1/2 interval
  * review_counts: total number of reviews
  * state: the location of the restauant
  * city
  * street_address
  * latitude
  * longitude
  
--> Search API documentation: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search


* reviews.csv
   * restaurant_name: the name of the restaurant 
   * reiview_1: one review of the customer
   * review_2: one review of the customer
   * review_3: one review of the customer

--> Reviews API documentation: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews

**Note: This file only stores the three reviews returned by the API endpoints. At this time, the API does not return restaurants without any reviews. **


### Database

There will be three tables stored in the database:

* Table1: Restaurants
  * id: PRIMARY KEY
  * restaurant_name
  * price_level
  * ratings
  * reviews_count
  * logitude
  * latitude
  * category id: FOREIGN KEY points to Table2 Category(id)
  * review id:  FOREIGN KEY points to Table3 Reviews(id)
  
  
* Table2: Categories
  * id: PRIMARY KEY
  * category
  
* Table3: Reivews
  * id: PRIMARY KEY
  * review_1
  * review_2
  * review_3
  
  
### An Interactive Map

Unlike database, this interactive map allows the users to interact with all the restaurants' information we gained in this project! 

Map is generated by Tableau, which will be displayed on the web. It shows all the restaurants on Yelp in Ann Arbor. User can click on any category to see the corresponding restaurants on the map. Upon hover over, it shows the details of the restaurant information. Point size indicates the number of ratings, with bigger size meaning more number of reviews, and point color indicates the average rating.

Have fun!
